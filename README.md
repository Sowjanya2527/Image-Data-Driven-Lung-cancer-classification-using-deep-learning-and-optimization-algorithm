# Lung Cancer Project
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, making  early and accurate detection crucial for patient survival. This project presents a novel 
framework that combines deep learning with Bayesian optimization techniques for efficient lung cancer classification. The proposed approach utilizes convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) optimized through Bayesian hyperparameter tuning to enhance classification accuracy and reduce model training time. The study aims to develop an automated diagnostic system 
that can effectively analyze medical imaging data, particularly CT scans, to identify and classify different types of lung cancer. By incorporating Bayesian optimization for 
hyperparameter tuning, the research seeks to overcome the challenges of traditional manual parameter selection and improve the overall efficiency of deep learning models in medical 
image classification. This framework is expected to contribute to the field of computer-aided diagnosis by providing healthcare professionals with a more reliable and efficient tool 
for lung cancer detection and classification. The research will evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics and validate its effectiveness through comprehensive testing on established medical datasets.
