#Image Data-Driven Lung Cancer Classification Using Deep Learning and Bayesian Optimization
üìö Project Overview

This project aims to classify lung cancer images into different stages (malignant, benign, or normal) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) combined with Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters. The CNN model is trained on CT scan images, and Bayesian Optimization is used to optimize the hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, and epochs) for improved accuracy and reduced training time.

The purpose of this project is to assist healthcare professionals by providing an early-stage diagnostic tool for lung cancer, ultimately leading to better treatment outcomes for patients.
